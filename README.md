# WI24_LIS545B_Term_Project

This repository was completed as part of a final term project for the UW MLIS course 545, Data Curation 1: Fundamentals. The project asked students to curate a dataset. The dataset I selected, and which is described and partially included in this repository, comes from the U.S. Forest Service and describe the features of over 82,000 trails in the U.S. 

This repository contains the following files:

	1. A compressed CSV file describing 77 unique features of each of the 82,352 trails located on U.S. Forest Service land
 	2. An XML metadata document describing the dataset, following the DataCite metadata schema (note that the "identifier" element does not contain a DOI, per the DataCite schema requirements, because the original dataset does not contain a DOI, only a URL)
	3. The student's final report, which describes the dataset, associated metadata, an appropriate repository for the data, and other considerations for its preservation and use
